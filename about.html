The goal of the Ascend Foundation is to help make a difference in the Pan-Asian community and industry in major North American metropolitan regions.

	            				The Ascend Foundation engages in both basic and applied research to create applicable ways for the Pan-Asian community in North America to become better innovators, role models and catalysts for change. The Ascend Foundation research findings support and advocate the Pan-Asian community by cultivating the leadership skills needed to improve the stance of Pan-Asians in North American corporate environments as well as recognize skills that could propel them to leadership positions. The Ascend Foundation aims to reach an understanding of how to integrate multiple cultures and leadership styles leading to global success.

            				<h4>The Ascend Foundation research is focused on three distinctive areas:</h4>
            				<ul>
    							<li>
    								How innovation and cross-cultural enrichment opens doors to leadership positions for Pan-Asians and helps create role models and pioneers for the Pan-Asian community in North America
    							</li>
    							<li>
    								The potential need to rewrite the Pan-Asian narrative as it relates to the characteristics and communal heritage that Pan-Asians share and the potential challenges and advantages this combination poses to their full ability to become leaders
    							</li>
    							<li>
    								Leveraging existing Pan-Asian and other minority leaders as change agents and catalysts and highlighting the significance of creating fluid, yet structured, networks to foster and maintain dynamic connections amongst good ideas, as well as enhance the diversity of management systems
    							</li>
